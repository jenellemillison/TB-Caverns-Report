# ImageCLEF-2022-Tuberculosis-Caverns-Report
This project is based off the following challenge: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/imageclef-2022-tuberculosis-caverns-report

To run this code on your own device:

Use Google Drive to store the folders and Google Colab to run the scripts.

1. Download the images in the Image Files folder
2. Run the TB_Caverns_GZ_NII_to_JPG.ipynb in the TB_Caverns_Scripts folder to extract the .nii.gz files to JPGs. This is necessary for all of the models except 3D-CNN. Be sure to modify the file paths to your liking.
3. Modify the file paths in all of the model files in the TB_Caverns_Scripts folder to match the file paths you set in step 2.
4. Run whichever CNNs you want!
